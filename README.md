# Lead_Scoring_CaseStudy_Upgrad
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. 

**There are quite a few goals for this case study:**
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.

**Repository contains 4 files:**
Python commented file: detailed comments and Code.
Word File: questions asked by the company in the word document .
Presentation:  Presentation to the chief data scientist of your company
PDF File: Summary report in a PDF file
